The issue was caused by a conflict with another CSS framework that was included higher in my stylesheet import stack than Tailwind CSS. By moving the Tailwind import after other conflicting CSS imports, the issue resolved itself.  I also made sure there were no conflicting class names between frameworks.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Corrected code)
// ... other imports ...
import './node_modules/other-css-framework/index.css'; //Moved this import after the tailwind import
import './output.css'; // Tailwind CSS import
// ... rest of your code ...
```
